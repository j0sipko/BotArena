BOT ARENA:

- source code from my School project for Bachelor Thesis (Without Codeblocks setup) but with some new stuff (haven't worked on it for a while though)
- app is used to teach programming in fun way, you can control your own character with specific commands (like moveForward()/TurnLeft()/Shoot()...)
- textures referenced in code are available in bin folder as well as SDL libraries (you might need to move them if you try to run it as project)
- there is also old release executable which can run this app as a game (you press P to pause and add objects/bots)
